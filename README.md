## sample prompts and answers
Ask MarxBot: what is surplus value
 Sure, I'd be happy to provide the answer. Surplus-value is a concept that refers to the additional profit or revenue that can be generated by capitalists by using technology and machinery. This extra revenue is created through the reduction of the necessary input (i.e., the cost of producing goods or services) for a given level of output, which is known as the "absolute surplus-value." Relative surplus-value refers to the additional profit generated when a different method of production such as the use of machines or animals is used in place of humans. This extra revenue can be seen as the capitalist mode's ability to reduce costs and increase output while still maintaining profitability.

Ask MarxBot: What is the dictatorship of the proletariat?
 The dictatorship of the proletariat refers to the total control by a class over another class, specifically referring to the political power held by workers who are organized as a ruling class. This control is achieved through entire sections of the ruled classes being "rapidly" (i.e., rapidly) thrust into the proletariat, while also providing them with new elements of education and progress in order for the proletariat to drag the bougeoisie (the ruled classes) into the political arena. The proletariat itself furnishes its own instruments of political and general education through its weapons for fighting the bougeoisie, i.e., it furnishes them with the weapons they need to wage their struggle against the bougeoisie.
